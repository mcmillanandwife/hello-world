# hello-world
git hub tutorial

 This is the very beginning of my career as a developer. Having completed tutotials in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, JQUERY, Angular and now BASH, I look forward to moving on to Python and feel like my destination will be as a Rails Developer. I listen to the CodeNewbie Podcast every week and often complete Odin Project tutorials many nights once I get home after my 12 shift. I love what I do as a professional Sommelier but feel a deep pull from the world of developers and get the sense that this is where I belong. Time will tell but you can't hit a homerun unless you swing the bat.
